Rules:
If a chip is ever left in the same area as another generator, and it's not connected to its own generator, the chip will be fried.
Elevator can carry at most yourself and two generators or microchips in any combination.
The elevator will only function if it contains at least one RTG or microchip.
you and the elevator will start on the first floor.

There are only 4 ^ 11 = 4,194,304 different states available. (Not to mention several of them are invalid.)
Hopefully this means I am able to track them all.
